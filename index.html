        I am a talented, ambitious and hardworking individual, with broad skills and experience in digital and printed marketing, social media and leading projects.
        Furthermore, I am adept at handling multiple tasks on a daily basis competently and at working well under pressure.
        A key strength is communication; building strong relationships with people in order to deliver the best results.
        Recently, I completed an Open degree, including Business and Design modules at the Open University and I am now fully employed by Clearly Presented as a Digital Media Manager.
